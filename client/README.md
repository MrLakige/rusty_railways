# Rusty Railways Client

This is a [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) based client to create the train track and control/see the status of the train system.

It will (hopefully) let you **Create** and **Edit** the **Train Track**, place the **NFC Tags**, **Trains** and **upload** everything to the Controller,
**Control** and **Monitor** the **High Level Controller**, **Scheduler**, **Trains** and **Switches**.
