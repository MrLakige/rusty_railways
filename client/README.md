# Rusty Railways Client

This is a Godot based client for the whole Rusty Railways project.
It will (hopefully) let you **Create and Edit** the **Train Track**, place the **NFC Tags**, Trains and **upload** everything to the Controller.
**Control and Monitor** the **High Level Controller**, **Scheduler**, **Trains** and **Switches**.
